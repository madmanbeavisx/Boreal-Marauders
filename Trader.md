# It is time
So with this update I have laid the groundwork for us to be able to start on quest lines.

I will be starting to add quests from here on as well as some new items that you guys and girls have said that you liked. Please keep up the support and we'll see how far I can take this.

# Meet our leader
May I introduce to you **Victor "Frostbite" Mikhailovich Morozov** a former Spetsnaz operative with a reputation as cold and unrelenting as the Siberian winters he was trained in. Standing tall with piercing, ice-blue eyes, his presence alone chills those around him. Known for his calculated precision in both combat and strategy, Viktor earned the codename Frostbite due to his ruthless efficiency and ability to outlast even the harshest conditions. His loyalty lies only with his brothers-in-arms, the Boreal Marauders, where he leads with a frozen resolve, making him both feared and respected in the unforgiving world of Tarkov.

Victor views the Boreal Marauders as the vanguard of a larger mission: to take back the frozen, war-torn regions of Tarkov and restore them to their former glory. For him, the cold wilderness isn’t just a battlefield—it’s home, and he is determined to purge the chaos that has desecrated it. 

### His goals include:

- **Reclaiming the Homeland**: Viktor's primary objective is to reclaim the northern territories, once rich and strategic, now ravaged by war and neglect. He seeks to drive out all factions, bandits, and invaders who threaten the region's stability, securing it for the Boreal Marauders.

- **Restoring Order and Glory**: Viktor dreams of restoring the lands to a state of order and discipline. Under his leadership, the Boreal Marauders will become a force of justice, eliminating anyone who dares disrupt the region’s recovery. By restoring infrastructure and controlling vital resources, he aims to return the region to a prosperous state under his rule.

- **Cleansing the Land**: To achieve this, Viktor is ruthless in his approach. He intends to hunt down and eradicate all who oppose his vision, including hostile factions, scavengers, and those who profit from the region’s decay. His ultimate goal is to cleanse the land of its enemies, allowing only the strong and the loyal to remain.

- **Establishing a Fortress of Strength**: Viktor envisions building a fortified capital in the heart of the reclaimed territory, where the Boreal Marauders will rule as protectors and overseers. This stronghold will serve as the symbol of his authority and the beacon of hope for those who wish to rebuild under his protection.

- **Uniting the Survivors**: Viktor believes that true strength comes from unity. He plans to unite the survivors of Tarkov’s wilderness under the banner of the Boreal Marauders, forging a powerful coalition dedicated to rebuilding the region and defending it from any future threats. Those who refuse his vision will be eliminated.
